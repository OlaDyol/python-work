# TITLE: Section 6 - "f shorthand"(3 minutes)

# Here we will introduce the primary method with which we will be inserting variables directly
# into strings, called "f shorthand". Let's set some variables and insert them in a string that has
# a lowercase "f" right before the first quotation mark in the string.

student1, student2, student3 = "Maria", "Sam", "Chris"

attendance_output = f"The present students are {student1}, {student2}, and {student3}."

# "f shorthand" also implements type conversion in its execution. Any variable used inside f shorthand
# will be converted to a string in the output of a print statement. Let's see how "f shorthand"
# handles integers and strings together.

num1, num2, num3 = 7, 8, 9
print(f"Why was 6 afraid of {num1}?")
print(f"Because {num1} {num2} {num3}!")

# TAKEAWAY:
# "f shorthand" makes it easy to print outputs without needing to go through type conversion. In
# the above examples, "f shorthand" handles strings perfectly fine as well as the ability to handle
# strings and integers together without needing to concatenate.

# Concatenation (+) can only be done with strings, not strings and integers/floats. Commas, however,

# TODO: Section 4:
# Set a variable equal to each of the types we have learned so far. That includes
# integers, floats, booleans, None, and strings. So, have one variable per each
# of those types (i.e. exampleInt = 0, exampleBool = False, etc.).
# To check the type of something in python, you use the type() function.
# For example, type("Hello") would yield string, and type(6) would yield int.
# So, create on print statement that would print the type of each variable you've set.

# Takeaway:
# Types are important in Python and you can check different elements' types using type().
# The type() function is an example of a polymorphic function, meaning that the same
# function name can be used for different types.

# TODO: Section 5:

# Lastly, we will introduce type conversion. There are functions you can use to
# convert things in Python. The first type conversion function we will use is str().
# Try the problem from Section 3, but use plus signs to concatenate strings and
# print "My name is [name here] and I am [age here] years old." using the name and age
# variables. However, this time when you're concatenating the age variable, wrap it in the
# str() function as such: str(age). The print statement will no longer throw an
# error üéØ since age was converted to a string.

# Takeaway:
# We can change types in Python when appropriate, and we learned one way to do so with str()

Lets calculate a company's taxes, profit, and then divide the profit amongst shareholders.
"""

# TODO: Section 1:
# TIP: Use print statements to test your code along the way.

# Set the following variables and constants:
# Set a constant of "TAX_RATE" equal to .20 (we will use this as twenty percent).

# Receive a user input for the question "What was your revenue for this year?". Set
# the input equal to a variable called "revenue".
# HINT: What varible type do you want "revenue" to be?

# Set a variable equal to "taxes_paid". Calculate the taxes by multipling the rate (20%)
# from your previous variable by the revenue input from the user.

# Set a new variable called "profit". Calculate the revenue minus the taxes paid and set it
# equal to this variable.

# In this lesson we went over changing the value of a variable. In this example, your company
# is taking a one time charge of 50%. This is done by executing the following:
# profit = profit / 2 #IMPORTANT: Uncomment this line before moving on.

# TODO: Section 1.1:
# Print an output indicating "Company ____ recorded $______  in revenue this year,
# paid $______ in taxes, recorded a profit of $______, and paid $______ to their five
# shareholders, evenly". Be sure to format to look like normal dollar amounts - "$xx.xx"
# HINT: 
# To format decimal points to show only to the nearest hundreth, you must add ":.2f" after a
# variable is inserted. This would look like "{var_name:.2f}". So if var_name is equal to 4.837478,
# then the output would be "4.84".

# TAKEAWAY:
# 1) Variables that have input functions stored in them will be of the string type. To use them in
#    math operations, you must convert them to an integer or float.
# 2) You can alter the value of a variable by setting it equal to an operation on itself.
